# Smarter-Emergency-Dispatch
Reducing response times with predictive modeling, optimization, and automation.  Efficiently staging and dispatching emergency medical services (EMS) is critical in an industry where saving minutes saves lives. EMS providers are often privately owned, and their performance can be measured by their response times (time from receiving a call to arriving on site). However, dispatch can be a very manual process, and I see significant human and market value in a data-driven system that can do it better. Check out my proposal doc for details!
